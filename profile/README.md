# Triangulation of Innovative Methods to End Alzheimers Disease (TIME-AD)

The Triangulation of Innovative Methods to End AD (TIME-AD) program aims to strengthen causal inference in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) research by addressing biases common in observational studies. Using an evidence triangulation framework, TIME-AD integrates complementary analytical approaches—including doubly robust methods, instrumental variable techniques, and quantitative bias analysis—to assess risk factors for AD/ADRD. The program includes four key projects examining the effects of alcohol use, depression, sensory impairments, and social isolation on cognitive aging.

This github organization houses our publically available code and guidance.

# Triangulation of Innovative Methods to End Alzheimers Disease (TIME-AD)

The Triangulation of Innovative Methods to End AD (TIME-AD) program aims to strengthen causal inference in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) research by addressing biases common in observational studies. Using an evidence triangulation framework, TIME-AD integrates complementary analytical approaches—including doubly robust methods, instrumental variable techniques, and quantitative bias analysis—to assess risk factors for AD/ADRD. The program includes four key projects examining the effects of alcohol use, depression, sensory impairments, and social isolation on cognitive aging. Supported by specialized data, analytics, and equity-focused cores, TIME-AD ensures rigorous, diverse, and actionable research to improve outcomes for underrepresented populations.
